            <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>In my Machine Learning project, I developed a text classifier using C++ to 
                    analyze and categorize textual data based on training and test datasets. 
                    The implementation involved processing CSV files to extract relevant features, 
                    such as unique words and their frequencies, enabling the model to learn from
                     labeled training data. I utilized probabilistic methods to predict the labels
                      of unseen test data, demonstrating the classifier's accuracy through performance
                       metrics. The project enhanced my skills in machine learning concepts and C++ 
                       programming while providing a solid
                     foundation in data preprocessing and statistical analysis for text classification.

        <h3>Pairing Priority Queue</h3>
            <p>The Pairing Priority Queue project showcases a cutting-edge implementation of 
                the priority queue abstract data type, utilizing a pairing heap structure for 
                enhanced efficiency. Built from the ground up in C++, this project features a highly 
                optimized system for managing elements through advanced operations like insertion, 
                deletion, and priority updates. By employing a specialized node structure and a
                 melding approach, the queue ensures efficient element retrieval and management,
                  maintaining performance even as the data structure scales. This implementation 
                  emphasizes clean, modular code with a focus on algorithms, providing a practical
                   demonstration of my ability to tackle complex data structures and algorithms 
                   effectively. Through this project, I've not only refined my programming skills
                    but also deepened my understanding of priority queues, showcasing my readiness
                     for real-world software development challenges.

        <h3>SillyQL</h3>
            <p>In the SillyQL project, I developed a SQL query engine that processes 
                and executes commands such as CREATE, INSERT, JOIN, REMOVE, PRINT, and GENERATE INDEX using a 
                custom parsing
                 and execution framework. This involved implementing various data structures to manage 
                 tables and relational data while supporting complex queries, including filtering, joining, 
                 and aggregating datasets. I designed a robust parser to interpret user inputs, ensuring efficient
                  translation of commands into actionable operations within the engine. The project not only 
                  enhanced my proficiency in C++ but also deepened my understanding of database concepts, 
                  including data integrity and query optimization. Overall, SillyQL showcases my ability to 
                  tackle complex programming challenges and deliver 
                functional software solutions while mastering essential database commands.

        <h3>Advanced Assembler</h3>
            <p>This advanced assembler project focuses on translating LC-2K assembly 
                code into machine code, implementing rigorous error handling and symbol 
                table management. The assembler processes up to 1000 lines of assembly, 
                parsing labels and instructions while ensuring that all inputs adhere to
                 defined constraints, such as valid label formats and register ranges.
                  It features a two-pass architecture for accurate address resolution,
                   handling both local and global labels, and generating relocation 
                   entries when necessary. The project showcases strong algorithmic
                    skills and attention to detail, crucial for developing efficient
                     and robust software. This experience highlights my ability to 
                tackle complex coding challenges and work with low-level programming concepts.

        <h3>Delivery Drone</h3>
            <p>In this project, I implemented a multi-mode graph processing application that efficiently 
                calculates minimum spanning trees (MST) and solves traveling salesman problems (TSP),
                 specifically aimed at optimizing delivery routes. Leveraging advanced algorithms, I built a 
                 robust command-line interface to accept user inputs and options, enabling seamless operation 
                 across different graph scenarios. The MST mode computes the minimal connections between vertices,
                  while the FASTTSP mode uses an insertion heuristic to generate quick routes through given 
                  coordinates. The OPTTSP mode employs a permutation-based approach to find the optimal path,
                   ensuring minimal travel distance. This project deepened
                    my understanding of graph theory and algorithm design, showcasing my ability to 
                develop complex software solutions tailored for efficient delivery logistics.

        <h3>Cybersecurity Attacks</h3>
            <p>In the EECS 388 Cybersecurity project, I implemented a series of advanced cryptographic
                 attacks, including length extension attacks, hash collision attacks, padding oracle 
                 attacks, and RSA signature forgery. Additionally, I executed various web 
                 vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), 
                 and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This project enhanced my understanding 
                 of security principles and the importance of safeguarding against these common
                  threats in modern applications. Through hands-on experience, I developed a
                   comprehensive skill set in both cryptography and web security.

        <h3>Mine Escape</h3>
        <p>Developed in C++, the Mine Escape project is an immersive command-line
             application that challenges users to navigate a treacherous minefield filled with rubble
              and TNT tiles. By employing a sophisticated 2D vector representation of the minefield, 
              it offers dynamic features such as tile discovery, clearance management, and comprehensive
               rubble statistics. Leveraging priority queues, the application optimizes tile selection
                based on difficulty, allowing users to track their progress with real-time median difficulty
                 metrics. Additionally, it boasts customizable command-line options for enhanced user 
                 experience, including verbose output and detailed statistics that highlight the first 
                 and last cleared tiles. This project not only sharpens coding skills but also provides

        <h3>Letterman</h3>
        <p>Project Letterman is a command-line application designed for morphing words using various 
            methods. 
            Implemented in C++, the project demonstrates advanced string manipulation 
            techniques and efficient data handling through STL containers like vector 
            and deque. By incorporating a recursive
            backtracking algorithm, Letterman explores all possible word morphing paths, 
            ensuring that users can see how they got to their final word. Additionally, the 
            application allows users to specify options like search mode (queue or stack) and 
            modification types, effectively showcasing algorithmic thinking and problem-solving 
            skills. This project
